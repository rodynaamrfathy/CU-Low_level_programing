One of my most impactful projects is a physics engine developed in C# and WPF, which evolved into an interactive online air hockey game. Initially, I aimed to build a realistic 2D physics simulation with forces like gravity and collision detection, which I achieved through a custom PhysicsEngine and SlimDX for accurate movement. As the project progressed, I transformed it into an air hockey game, adding real-time interactivity and networked multiplayer features. This required both robust physics handling and a deep understanding of C# and WPF, enhancing my skills in both simulation and game design.
Another project Iâ€™m proud of is EatsExpress, an online food ordering and delivery platform for the Egyptian market. This platform connects users to local restaurants, enabling them to browse cuisines, place orders, and track delivery in real-time. Building EatsExpress presented several technical challenges that advanced my expertise in backend development and system architecture. The backend, built in Flask with SQLAlchemy, required designing efficient database schemas and implementing RESTful routes for a seamless user experience. A particular challenge was developing an order-tracking feature that dynamically updates delivery status. Using a combination of Flask, database transactions, and optimized queries, I created a system where users can monitor their orders from placement to delivery, ensuring a smooth, reliable experience.
My work on EatsExpress reflects my problem-solving abilities, especially in managing complex backend workflows and maintaining high performance. The architecture I implemented supports scalability, aligning with our vision to integrate AI-powered recommendations and expand EatsExpress across regions.
In addition to EatsExpress, I developed FitPulse, a fitness platform featuring a supplement store, progress tracking, and nutrition calculators. This project highlights my commitment to user-centered design, providing a comprehensive tool for users to manage their health journeys.
